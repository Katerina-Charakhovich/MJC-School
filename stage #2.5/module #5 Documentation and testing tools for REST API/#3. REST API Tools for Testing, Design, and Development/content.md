###3. Overview

These REST API testing and development tools will help you to test your APIs as you build, starting from unit testing 
to integration testing and then fully automating your resting to create a regression pack.

You can also use these tools to interact with your REST API during the development phase for quick tests.

###3.1. Postman [API testing tool] 

Originally a Google Chrome plug-in, Postman has grown into one of the top API testing tools. With its main objective
being the testing of API services, it has expanded its services to include native versions of Windows and Mac. 
Either way, it’s a great option for exploratory or manual testing. Postman enables you to monitor APIs, automate tests,
debug, and run requests. Features are abundant, it’s free, and it’s rated highly by users.

###3.2. SoapUI 

SoapUI is a functional testing tool that is the world’s leading solution for SOAP and REST testing. In essence, 
it works as a headless API testing tool. You can quickly and easily create and execute automated functional, regression,
and load tests with SoapUI’s user-friendly graphical interface and enterprise-class features. Several protocols and 
technologies are supported by SOAPUI to test all types of APIs. The SOAPUI interface is intuitive, so technical users 
and non-techies alike can use it seamlessly.

###3.3. RESTAssured [The Tool for Automation Testing] 

You should consider Rest-assured if you’re planning to test RESTful services in Java.
It is an open-source platform that offers Java domain-specific languages to make it easier to test REST services.
JSON and XML-based applications are frequently tested with it.

###3.4. Swagger [Tool for Design and Document REST APIs] 

Swagger is another great tool for REST API development that you can use to document and share your REST API 
specification. Swagger provides a standard format to describe REST APIs.

By following those rules you can create REST API documents to share among product managers, testers, and developers,
but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes

It’s also known as Open API Specification and it's currently the most popular way to create definitions of RESTful APIs.
With these definitions, you can create sophisticated, autogenerated documentation, generate SDKs in several languages,
and do automated testing

###3.5. Curl 

The curl or cURL command allows you to send different types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE which you
can use to test basic functionalities of your REST APIs as shown in my earlier article about testing REST APIs using 
the curl command in Linux.

It also allows you to set HTTP headers which means you can set Content-Type or Accept header to test content
negotiation like you can set Content-Type=”application/json” to get a JSON response from the REST API.
